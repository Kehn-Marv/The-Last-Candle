# Horror Game Design Principles for The Last Candle

## Core Horror Elements

### Atmosphere Over Jump Scares
The Last Candle focuses on psychological horror through:
- **Isolation**: Player is alone in a dark house with minimal NPCs
- **Vulnerability**: Limited HP (only 3) makes every encounter dangerous
- **Uncertainty**: Multiple endings create moral ambiguity
- **Minimalism**: Sparse UI and dialogue increase tension

### Environmental Storytelling
Each room tells a story without explicit exposition:
- **Living Room**: Starting point, safe but ominous
- **Bedroom**: Personal space invaded by supernatural presence
- **Office**: Final confrontation location, claustrophobic

## Player Agency & Consequences

### Meaningful Choices
Player decisions have permanent consequences:
1. **NPC Interaction**: Help or refuse the trapped soul
2. **Monster Encounter**: Fight or flee
3. **Item Usage**: Resource management affects survival

### Multiple Endings Philosophy
- **Good Ending**: Compassion and bravery rewarded
- **Bad Ending**: Selfishness leads to doom
- **True Ending**: Hidden path for observant players

## Pacing & Tension

### Slow Burn Approach
1. **Act 1 (Living Room)**: Exploration, learning controls, building unease
2. **Act 2 (Bedroom)**: NPC encounter, moral choice, rising tension
3. **Act 3 (Office)**: Climax, monster confrontation, resolution

### Tension Through Mechanics
- **Limited Resources**: Few healing items, scarce weapons
- **Permanent Consequences**: HP doesn't regenerate easily
- **Time Pressure**: Monster actively hunts player
- **Restricted Vision**: Top-down view limits awareness

## Visual Horror Design

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Black (#000000) for backgrounds and shadows
- **Secondary**: Dark gray (#2c2c2c) for walls and structures
- **Accent**: White (#ffffff) for UI and important elements
- **Danger**: Red for damage indicators and warnings

### Sprite Design
- **Player**: Small, vulnerable-looking character
- **Monster**: Tall, imposing figure (Tall Monster.png)
- **NPCs**: Ghostly, ethereal appearance
- **Items**: Recognizable but slightly unsettling

### UI Philosophy
- Minimal HUD (only HP and inventory)
- No minimap (increases disorientation)
- Retro font (Press Start K) for nostalgic horror feel
- Bottom-aligned inventory (doesn't obstruct view)

## Audio Design Strategy

### Ambient Soundscape
- **Background Music**: Continuous, unsettling loop
- **Silence**: Strategic absence of sound for tension
- **No Jump Scare Sounds**: Maintains psychological horror focus

### Player Control
- Audio toggle in options respects player preference
- Some players prefer silence for maximum immersion

## Narrative Design

### Show, Don't Tell
- Minimal dialogue boxes
- Environmental clues (room layout, item placement)
- Player interprets story through exploration

### Ambiguity & Mystery
- Who is the NPC? Why are they trapped?
- What is the monster? Where did it come from?
- What is "The Last Candle"? Why is it significant?
- Leave questions unanswered for player imagination

### Moral Complexity
- No clear "right" choice in NPC interaction
- Good ending isn't necessarily "happy"
- True ending reveals deeper truth

## Gameplay Balance

### Difficulty Curve
- **Easy Start**: Safe living room for learning
- **Medium Challenge**: Bedroom with NPC dialogue
- **Hard Finale**: Office with active monster threat

### Player Empowerment
- **Inventory System**: Gives sense of preparation
- **Multiple Paths**: Player chooses approach
- **Save System**: Reduces frustration, allows experimentation

### Risk vs Reward
- Exploring thoroughly finds more items
- Rushing through is safer but less prepared
- Helping NPC is risky but morally rewarding

## Replayability

### Encouraging Multiple Playthroughs
- Three distinct endings to discover
- Different strategies (combat vs stealth)
- Speedrun potential for skilled players
- Hidden secrets for completionists

### Secrets & Easter Eggs
- True ending requires specific actions
- Hidden items in obscure locations
- Environmental details reward observation

## Technical Horror Techniques

### Camera & Perspective
- Top-down view creates vulnerability (can't see ahead)
- Fixed camera (no rotation) increases disorientation
- Limited screen space creates claustrophobia

### Movement & Control
- Slightly slow movement speed builds tension
- Collision with walls creates frustration (intentional)
- Diagonal movement penalty makes escape harder

### Monster AI
- Relentless pursuit creates pressure
- Slower than player (escapable but threatening)
- Collision damage is significant (1/3 of total HP)

## Accessibility Considerations

### Player Comfort
- No flashing lights or strobing effects
- Audio can be muted for sensitive players
- Save system allows breaks without losing progress
- Multiple difficulty levels through player choice

### Control Options
- WASD and Arrow keys both supported
- Simple control scheme (movement only, no complex combos)
- Mouse for inventory (intuitive point-and-click)

## Post-Launch Considerations

### Potential Expansions
- Additional rooms/areas
- New monster types
- More items and weapons
- Extended narrative branches

### Community Engagement
- Encourage fan theories about story
- Speedrun leaderboards
- Fan art of monster/character designs
- Let's Play and streaming content
